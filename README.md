# CosmicLearn
A quick learning program I made in ~3 days, as a kind of Quizlet replacement.

## Setup
I recommend downloading it from the [releases tab](https://github.com/Brainstorm4266/CosmicLearn/releases/), but if you want to, you can also build CosmicLearn by yourself.
To build it yourself, you must have Visual Studio (I used version 2022) with .NET Core (version 6) support, or just use msbuild.

## Configuration
You may configure CosmicLearn by using the `config.json` file in the location where you unpacked CosmicLearn.
This file is generated automatically when you start the program.
