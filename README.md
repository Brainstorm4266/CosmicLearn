# CosmicLearn
A quick learning program I made in ~3 days, as a kind of Quizlet replacement.

## Setup
I recommend downloading it from the [releases tab](https://github.com/Brainstorm4266/CosmicLearn/releases/), but if you want to, you can also build CosmicLearn by yourself.
To build it yourself, you must have Visual Studio (I used version 2022) with C# support, or just use msbuild.
